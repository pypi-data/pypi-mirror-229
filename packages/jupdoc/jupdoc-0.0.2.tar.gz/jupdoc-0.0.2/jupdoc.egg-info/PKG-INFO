# JupDoc: Convert Jupyter Notebooks with Role-Based Access Control

JupDoc is a Python package that simplifies the process of converting Jupyter Notebooks into multiple docx files or other formats while applying role-based access control based on cell tags.

_Please note that this package is still under development, and the documentation is not complete. There may be bugs and the API may change._

## Features

- Convert Jupyter Notebooks to docx, PDF, HTML, and more.
- Define access roles using cell tags.
- Generate separate documents for each access role.

## Installation

You can install JupDoc using pip:
```bash
pip install jupdoc
```
JupDoc is based on Quarto to convert ipynb files to other formats. The instructions to install quarto can be found [here](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html).

## Usage
We support two ways to convert notebooks to docs. The first one is using the command line interface. The second one is using the python API.

### Command Line Interface
The command line interface can be used as follows:
```bash
jupdoc --config <config_file>
```
In case of absence of the config file, the configs can be passed as command line arguments:
```bash
jupdoc --filename <filename> --tags <tags> --prefix <prefix> --output <output> --format <format>
```
The arguments are as follows:
- `filename`: The path to the notebook file.
- `tags`: The tags to be used for access control. Multiple tags can be passed as a comma-separated string.
- `prefix`: The prefix to be used for the output files.
- `output`: The path to the output directory.
- `format`: File format to be exported to. 

### Python API
The python API can be used as follows:
```python
from jupdoc import convert
args = {
    "filename": "notebook.ipynb",
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
    "prefix": "prefix",
    "output": "output",
    "format": "docx"
}
convert(**args)
```

## To Do
1. Improve documentation.
2. Provide upload to Google Drive option.
3. Add support for report templates.
4. Add support for multiple cell tags.
