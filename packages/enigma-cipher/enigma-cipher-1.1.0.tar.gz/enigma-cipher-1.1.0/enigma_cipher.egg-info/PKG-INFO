# Enigma Cipher

The `Enigma Cipher` is a package that allows ciphering texts as an enigma machine would.

It is referred to 'cipher' the text instead of encoding/decoding, as any text can be encoded or decoded bz ciphering it with a machine with the same configuration.
For example, if the text `VLGBR OYWVV!` is ciphered through a machine with the correct configuration, the outcome will be `HELLO WORLD!`
