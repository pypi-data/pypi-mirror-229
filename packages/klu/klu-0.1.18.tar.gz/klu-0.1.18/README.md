## Description

SDK for building AI Enabled apps

The Klu.AI Python SDK is a library that provides access to the Klu.AI API, allowing users to interact with their workspace, applications, actions, data, models, and contexts.

## Requirements

The Klu.AI Python SDK requires Python version 3.7 or later.

## Installation

To install the Klu.AI Python SDK, simply run:

```
pip install klu
```

## Getting Started

To use the Klu.AI Python SDK, you must first obtain an API key from the Klu.AI website. Once you have your API key, you can create a `Klu` object:

```python
from klu import Klu

client = Klu("YOUR_API_KEY")
```

Once you have a `Klu` object, you can access the different models available in the Klu API:

```python
from klu import Klu

client = Klu("YOUR_API_KEY")
models = await client.models.get("model_guid")

```

There is also a separate function to stream action prompt

Each of these objects provides methods for interacting with the corresponding model in the Klu API. For example, to list all applications in your workspace, you can use:

```python
from klu import Klu

client = Klu("YOUR_API_KEY")
applications = client.applications.list()
```

In a similar manner, in order to get a list of data points for an action, you can do the following

```python
from klu import Klu

client = Klu("YOUR_API_KEY")
data = client.data.get_data("action_id")
```

There is a special client that allows to stream action prompts.
The streaming url can be received from the action creation response.

```python
from klu import Klu

client = Klu("YOUR_API_KEY")

prompt_response = await client.actions.prompt("action_guid", "prompt", streaming=True)
async for message in client.sse_client.get_streaming_data(prompt_response.streaming_url):
    print(message)
```
