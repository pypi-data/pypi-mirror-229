## 1. Description
UltraCOLOR is a Python library that provides functionality for working with different color spaces. It supports RGBA, Hex, HSLA and HSVA color spaces, allowing for accurate color conversion. The library does not require any third-party dependencies and only utilizes the Python standard library. With UltraCOLOR, you can easily convert colors between different color spaces and perform various operations on them.

## 2. Features
### 2.1 Does not require dependencies
This library **does not require** third party dependencies: *only* the Python >= 3.8 is required
### 2.2 Lightweight
UltraCOLOR is a lightweight library, making it a perfect choice for projects where performance is a key factor.
### 2.3 Easy to use
The library provides a simple and intuitive API, making it easy to perform complex color operations with just a few lines of code.
### 2.4 All major color spaces are supported
All major color spaces are supported: RGB, Hex, HSL and HSV.
### 2.5 Accurate color conversion
This is achieved by using the built-in type `Decimal`
```python
from ucolor import ColorRGBA, convert
foo = ColorRGBA(33, 33, 33)
bar = convert.rgba_to_hsla(foo)
baz = convert.hsla_to_rgba(bar)
print(foo == baz) # True
```
