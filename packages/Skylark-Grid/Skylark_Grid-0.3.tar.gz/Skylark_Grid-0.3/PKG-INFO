# Image Grid Maker
The Image Grid is a Python script that merges a set of images into a grid and generates YOLO-style annotations for the merged images. This can be useful for creating custom datasets for object detection tasks.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install Numpy
```
## Usage

Import the ImageMerger class in your Python script:

```bash
from Skylark_Grid import ImageMerger
```

Create an instance of the ImageMerger class by providing the input directory, output directory, and other optional parameters:
python

```bash
input_image_label_dir = "E:/Grid_Txt/Images"
output_dir = "E:/Grid_Txt/Output"
image_shape = (320, 320)  # Specify the desired image shape here
group_size = 9
try:
    merger = ImageMerger(input_image_label_dir, output_dir, group_size=group_size, image_shape=image_shape)
    merger.process_images()
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
```
## Customization
You can customize the script by modifying the ImageMerger class to fit your specific requirements. For example, you can adjust the image size, grid size, or annotation format.
