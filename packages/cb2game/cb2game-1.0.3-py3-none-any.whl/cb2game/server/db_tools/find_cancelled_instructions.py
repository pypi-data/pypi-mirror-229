""" Yikes, I forgot to introduce a column in the instructions DB for cancelled instructions.

    This is because cancelled instructions didn't exist originally, and when I added them, I never added any code to log it in the DB.

    This script will go through all the games and calculate cancelled
    instructions and fill them in the DB, similar to integrate_orientation.
    Pretty happy with my decision to log all client-server messages as it saves
    me in situations like this (this is actually exactly why I did that).
