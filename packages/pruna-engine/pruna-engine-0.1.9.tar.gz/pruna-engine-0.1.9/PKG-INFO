# Pruna Engine

Pruna Engine is a Python package providing the capability of running deep learning models optimized through Pruna AI.

## Installation

You can install Pruna Engine via pip from PyPI by specifying which tensorrt version you would like:

```shell
pip install pruna-engine[tensorrt-8.6.0] --extra-index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com
```
or
```shell
pip install pruna-engine[tensorrt-8.5.3.1] --extra-index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com
```

## Requirements
- You need to have CUDA toolkit installed on your machine. If you are using a conda environment you can do this by running:
```shell
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit
```
- You need CUDA 12 to be installed on your machine

## Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use Pruna Engine with a ResNet50 optimized model:

```python
from pruna_engine import load_model
# And 'your_api_key' is your actual API key
your_api_key = 'test'
optimized_model = load_model('resnet50_model', your_api_key)
# Run prediction
pred = optimized_model(test_input)
```
