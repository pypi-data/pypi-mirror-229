class AuthContext:
    """
    The AuthContext class is used to contain data about the user or client app that
    will be used to identify the program or user that is making calls to the server
    to get data or make updates.

    Any authorized calls as made from the python api expect an instance of an
    AuthContext class as a parameter.

    If you are creating an AuthContext class for a user you must call get_token
    to authorize the user id and password combination prior to making any calls.

    If you are creating an AuthContext for a client app, you must register
    that client app with the server and obtain a client_id and client token,
    you do not need to call get_token for client type AuthContext instances.
