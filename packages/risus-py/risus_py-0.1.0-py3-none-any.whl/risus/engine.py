"""The risus game engine.

This module implements the "unholy trinity" of the Risus game engine:
`combat`, `single_action_conflict`, and `target_number` checks. There
is also a seperate function for `team_combat`.

These functions all support breathrough rolls as described on page 54
of the Risus companion, as well as old-fashined exploding d6s.
