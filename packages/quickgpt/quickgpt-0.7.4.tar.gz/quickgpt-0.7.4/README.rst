   example of quickgpt command

**quickGPT** is a lightweight and easy-to-use Python library that
provides a simplified interface for working with the new API interface
of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. With quickGPT, you can easily generate natural
language responses to prompts and questions using state-of-the-art
language models trained by OpenAI.

For the record, this README was (mostly) generated with ChatGPT - hence
the braggy tone.

Like fine wine and cheddar, this library pairs nicely with the
`ElevenLabs <https://github.com/benbaptist/elevenlabs>`__ text-to-speech
API library.

Installation
------------

You can install **quickGPT** using pip:

.. code:: sh

   pip install quickgpt

Usage
-----

To use quickgpt, you’ll need an OpenAI API key, which you can obtain
from the OpenAI website. Once you have your API key, you can specify
your API key using an environment variable:

::

   export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

or by passing it to the ``api_key`` parameter of ``QuickGPT``:

::

   chat = QuickGPT(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")

See the examples for more information on how it works. Or, you can use
the ``quickgpt`` tool for an interactive ChatGPT session in your command
line. Make sure ``~/.local/bin/`` is in your ``$PATH``.

::

   usage: quickgpt [-h] [-k API_KEY] [-t THREAD] [-p PROMPT] [-l] [-n] [-i] [-v]

                           input as the prompt
     -i, --stdin           Takes a single prompt from stdin, and returns the
