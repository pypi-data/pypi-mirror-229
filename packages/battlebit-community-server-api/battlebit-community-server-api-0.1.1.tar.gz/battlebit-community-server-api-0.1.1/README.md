## Preamble

The goal of this project is to create an alternate, Python-implementation to the [official community server API](https://github.com/MrOkiDoki/BattleBit-Community-Server-API), which is written in C#. This project can be considered production-ready.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- A running, whitelisted BattleBit Server (Version 2.1.2)

## Usage

As a user of this API, there are two important things to know, `Handler`s and `Command`s. More on those in the following paragraphs. Basic examples on how to use this project can be found in `/battlebit_community_server_api/example`.

### Handlers

Handlers are the users way of hooking themselves onto certain events that are happening. Such as "A player joins the server" and "A player sent a chat message".

For each event, the user can register their own handler with the `ApiServer.register_handler` method. This method takes  an `OpCodes` value and any `Callable`.

**IMPORTANT:** Each handler has the signature `async def handler(d: bytes) -> bytes`. It receives the raw TCP message as an input and returns a TCP message.

Use `TcpParsingService` to parse the incoming data into the datamodel objects. Use `OutgoingGameServerMessage` to return data. Refer to the examples for further information.

#### Default Handlers

If there is no `Handler` registered for an OP-Code, the default `Handler` for that event is executed. The user can also use default `Handler`s in their own `Handler`, see `example/SendingCommands.py`.

#### Implementation status of default handlers

### Commands

While Handlers are triggered on an event and respond to the server, `Command`s can be executed at any point.

To execute an `Command`, pick a `Command` from the `Command` module (for example `Command.SayToChat`), use its initializer to prepare it, and then queue it for execution.

You can also build your own commands by using the `Command` base class.

To execute a command, use `ApiServer.add_command_to_queue`.

# Predefined OutgoingGameServerMessages
_New in version 0.1.1_

There are `OutgoingGameServerMessage`s that have already been preconfigured with the correct OP-Code and accept typed arguments.
Below is a list of the ones that are currently available.

| Name                  | Effect                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SetPlayerModification | Given a SteamID and a PlayerModification object, this OutgoingGameServerMessage will apply the modifications to the player with that SteamID (if that player is still on the server) |
| PlaceVoxelBlock       | Given a Vector3 and a VoxelBlockData object, this OutgoingGameServerMessage will place the specified block at the specified location.                                                |
| DestroyVoxelBlock     | Destroys a block at the specified location                                                                                                                                           |

The predefined `OutgoingGameServerMessage`s can be imported from `battlebit_community_server_api.helper.PredefinedOutgoingGameServerMessages`.

#### Adding commands from outside

At some point you might want to queue Commands or OutgoingGameServerMessages from outside the API loop.
You can find an example doing just that at `example/SetNewRoomSettings.py`.
