# FastAPI Response Time Middleware

`fastapi-response-time` is a simple middleware for FastAPI applications that adds an `X-Response-Time` header to responses, indicating how many milliseconds the server took to process the request.

## Inspiration

This middleware was inspired by the [response-time](https://github.com/expressjs/response-time) middleware for Express.js.

## Features

- Lightweight and easy to integrate.
- Configurable: Choose the precision (number of digits) and the header name.
- Optionally include units in the output.

## Installation

```bash
pip install fastapi-response-time
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example to get you started:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_response_time import ResponseTimeMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

app.add_middleware(ResponseTimeMiddleware)
```

Now, every response from your FastAPI application will include the `X-Response-Time` header.

## Local Development Setup

To set up a local development environment:

1. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. To build the package:

```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

## Testing

To test this middleware in your local environment, set up a test environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
pip install dist/fastapi-response-time-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Then, run the tests using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```
