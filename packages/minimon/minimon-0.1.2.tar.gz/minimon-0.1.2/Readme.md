# Minimon

**minimon** is a 'minimal' (as in minimal music) IT monitoring tool for the command line.

Compared to lots of other IT monitoring solutions it has the following main attributes:

- It follows a 'configuration as application' approach, i.e. instead of configuring your monitoring
  via UI you will 'write' your whole executable application yourself!
  (see example below for clarification)
- It's ultra-flexible by being more an 'automation with functional pipes' framework letting
  you anything do anything you can automate rather than a configurable application
- It's _minimal_ also in terms of a hobby project. Don't expect something which competes with
  Checkmk, Prometheus, etc.
- Since instead of configuring some black box application you have to implement / modify the main
  executable using plain Python, as a user you might get into Python programming rather quickly.


There are some technical properties and maxims you might be interested in as well:

- `textual` / `rich` based
- Heavy use of asynchronous programming
- Functional approaches wherever possible
- `asyncssh` instead of `paramiko`


## Installation

While you can just clone and use minimon, the intended way to use it is to install it from PyPI.org
or run it from inside a virtual environment.

Install it locally using `pip`:

```sh
[<PYTHON> -m] pip[3] install [--user] [--upgrade] minimon
```

Currently you need at least Python **v3.10+** installed in order to run **minimon**. In case your
system provides older versions only, consider using `pyenv` to install any other version next
to your system-Python.


## Example

The following snippet is taken from a recent **minimon** installation folder, e.g.
`~/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/minimon/sites/mvm.py` and shows a poorly minimalistic but
working example of a fully functional **minimon** site:

```python
from minimon import *
from minimon.plugins import *

with Monitor("MVM"):

    @view("host", [Host("localhost")])
    async def local_resources(host: Host) -> Insights:
        """This async generator will be invoked by the above `view` and run continuously to
        gather and yield monitoring data"""
        current_insights = {}
        async for name, lines in bundle(
            ps=Pipeline(process_output(host, "ps wauxw", "1"), processor=parse_du),
            df=Pipeline(process_output(host, "df -P", "2"), processor=parse_df),
            dmesg=Pipeline(process_output(host, "dmesg", "2"), processor=parse_dmesg),
        ):
            current_insights[name] = lines
            yield current_insights
```

Create/copy your own file to test and modify:

```sh
mkdir minimon-sites                                                                                                 130 ↵
cp ~/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/minimon/sites/mvm.py minimon-sites
chmod +x minimon-sites/mvm.py
```

Start it by executing
```
minimon-sites/mvm.py
```


## Why (do I do this?)

- async
- functional
- testability
- bullet proof


## Todo

This is very early development, no real todo-list here, yet. Some of the bigger tasks include

- [x] provide a way to use data propagating through functions by different consumers
- [ ] provide broader set of useful data sources and handlers (a.k.a 'plugins')
- [ ] provide monadic (async) function chaining
- [ ] capture and persist metrics
- [ ] visualize metrics
- [ ] provide ways to interact
- [ ] improve logging: to file, log threads, log task context
- [ ] and error handling


## Development & Contribution

### Setup

For active development you need to have `poetry` and `pre-commit` installed

```sh
python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user poetry pre-commit
git clone git@projects.om-office.de:frans/minimon.git
cd minimon
pre-commit install
# if you need a specific version of Python inside your dev environment
poetry env use ~/.pyenv/versions/3.10.4/bin/python3
poetry install
```


### Workflow

* Create/test/commit changes and check commits via `pre-commit`
* after work is done locally:
  - adapt version in `pyproject.toml`
  - build and check a package
```sh
poetry build && \
twine check dist/* &&
python3 -m pip uninstall -y minimon && \
python3 -m pip install --user dist/minimon-$(grep -E "^version.?=" pyproject.toml | cut -d '"' -f 2)-py3-none-any.whl
```
  - check installed package
  - publish the new package `poetry publish --build`
  - commit new version && push
