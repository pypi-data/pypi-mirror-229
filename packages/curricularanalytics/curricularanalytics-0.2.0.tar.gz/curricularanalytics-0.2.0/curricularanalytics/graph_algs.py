    Perform a depth-first traversal of input graph `g`.

    Args:
        g: Input graph.

    Returns:
        The classification of each edge in graph `g`, as well as the order in which vertices are
        first discovered during a depth-first search traversal, and when the processing from that vertex is completed
        during the depth-first traverlsa.

    According to the vertex discovery and finish times, each edge in `g` will be
    classified as one of:
    - *tree edge* : Any collection of edges in `g` that form a forest. Every vertex is either a single-vertex tree
    with respect to such a collection, or is part of some larger tree through its connection to another vertex via a
    tree edge. This collection is not unique defined on `g`.
    - *back edge* : Given a collection of tree edges, back edges are those edges that connect some descendent vertex
    in a tree to an ancestor vertex in the same tree.
    - *forward edge* : Given a collection of tree edges, forward edges are those that are incident from an ancestor
    in a tree, and incident to an descendent in the same tree.
    - *cross edge* : Given a collection of tree edges, cross edges are those that are adjacent between vertices in
    two different trees, or between vertices in two different subtrees in the same tree.
