Introduction
------------

**chess-analytica** is a chess library that allows for the simple scraping of data using the chess.com API, and subsequent 
analysis of that data.  Built on top of the python-chess library, chess-analytica allows for you to easily scrape 
all of a given player's past (or current) games, filter the games down, and then analyze them.

.. code:: python

    >>> from chess_analytica import Board, ChessDotCom

    >>> profile = ChessDotCom("aronfrish", False) #False means that it will not try to import the games from the "cache" folder

    >>> print(profile.games[0].white_player)
    #aronfrish

    >>> print(profile.games[0].final_state + " \n" + profile.games[0].link)
