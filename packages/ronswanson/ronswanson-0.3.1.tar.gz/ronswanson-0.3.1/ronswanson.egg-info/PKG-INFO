Ron Swanson builds tables for 3ML.

This tool provides an easy interface to construct 3ML table models from
computational expensive simulations on HPC systems. Why? Because it is your
right to do so!

## Installation

```sh
pip install ronswanson
```
or

```sh
git clone https://github.com/grburgess/ronswanson
cd ronswanson

### Documentation

Additions or examples, tutorials, or better explanations are always
welcome. To ensure that the documentation builds with the current

executed as jupyter notebooks when changes are pushed to Github.
