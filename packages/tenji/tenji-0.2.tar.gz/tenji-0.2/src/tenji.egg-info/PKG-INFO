# Tenji

Asyncronous Python client for scraping data from MyFigureCollection (MFC).

## Usage

```python
import asyncio
from tenji import MfcClient

async def main():
    client = MfcClient()
    profile = await client.get_profile("syntack")
    print(profile.status)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Authenticated Requests

There is some session support but as of right now the goal is to focus on non-authenticated requests.


### Notes

* The client currently relies on an English locale.
