Description: # Cmotions Nnect (Cmo-Nnect)
        
        cmo_nnect is a Python library created by [Cmotions](https://cmotions.nl/). This library aims to ease the interaction with different API's of software packages. Examples include Microsoft Dynamics, Exact Online, AFAS Profit etc. You only need the right authentication credentials, and the target endpoints of the source/destination API to start interacting!
        
        From our experience with integrating data from a variety of software packages we decided to publish our connectors to ease the use of the API's with Python. We encourage collaboration to increase the number of connectors and improvements of existing connectors!
        
        The package has parallelization functionality built in for most connectors. This means that you are able to provide a list of entities/tables/endpoints and they are retrieve from the data source in parallel.
        
        The library always returns a Pandas dataframe by default, or if you provide a list, it will return a dictionary with "entityname":"dataframe" key-valuepairs.

        <a id="installation"></a>
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install cmo_nnect using pip
        
        ```bash
        pip install cmo-nnect
        ```
        
        <a id="usage"></a>
        
        ## Usage
        
        Choose the [connector](#Available-connectors) from the list, and import the connector by using the reference name. For example for AFAS Profit the reference name is afasprofit:
        
        ```python
        from cmo_nnect import afasprofit
        ```
        
        From the [connector usage documentation](#Connector-usage) determine the authentication requirements, for example for AFAS Profit we need a token, a company-id, and an optional environment name. We can then initialize a client:
        
        ```python
        # define authentication credentials
        token = "<token><version>1</version><data>54740093832496081845474abcdefghijklmnopq740093832496081841234127</data></token>"
        company_id = 12345
        environment = "development"
        
        # set up a client to ease interaction
        client = afasprofit(token,company_id)
        ```
        
        We are now able to start interacting with the API. To extract data you can use the format client.get_data(). In the documentation of the specific connector you can see what is expected for the specific method. For example for AFAS Profit we need to provide a get_connector name, and optional parameters:
        
        ```python
        # define parameters
        params = {"skip": "-1", "take": "-1"}
        
        # extract data from the software package
        contacts = client.get_data("get_contacts", params)
        ```
        
        The package automatically parallelizes the processing when you provide a list of entities, where possible. If you are using this package in production, this would be the preferred way to ingest data.

        ```
        
        **Authentication**<br>
        To authenticate with Business Central you need an app registration in Azure Active Directory which has the correct access rights in Business Central.
        
        Then you need:
        
        - A Client ID (e.g. "f1234562-978c-4ae6-886e-eb0e90043775"), belonging to the app registration

        ```python
        from cmo_nnect import dynamics365
        ```
        
        **Authentication**<br>
        To authenticate with Dynamics 365 you need:
        
        - A Client id(e.g. "831fc512-1352-4c0d-af44-99af61e4dfd7")
        - A Client Secret of your app registration (e.g. ~WiJDFjfodj09uf8a9f)

        **Extracting data**<br>
        To get data, you need:
        
        - An entity name or a list of entity names which is you can find in the [Dynamics documentation](https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/safelinks/1/atp-safelinks.html) (e.g. "Account")
        
        <a id="Exact"></a>
        
        ## Exact
        
        **Import**<br>
        
        ```python
        from cmo_nnect import exact
        ```
        
        **Authentication**<br>
        To authenticate with Exact you need:
        
        - Exact base url (e.g. "https://start.exactonline.nl")
        - A Exact client id (e.g. "sfgs3456-3456-7889-b134-sadfg32431f")
        - A Exact client secret (e.g. "~Waifjdfaklf0889dhf")
        - SecretManagement Class (e.g. "SecretManagement.Env(env_variabele='exact_config')")
        
        Optionally:
        
        - authenticate, defaults to False. This boolean is used start the authenication flow of Exact, where we need to login into the browser and copy the code received into the input in order to receive our Exact config file with access_token and refresh_token. Only use the authentication flow if you use the connector for the first time or if you want to regenerate the Exact config file.
        
        **Interaction**<br>
        To initialize the Exact connector you need to provide a SecretManagement class. You can import the class using:
        `from cmo_nnect.helpers import SecretManagement`.
        The SecretManagement class has mutiple subclasses to store your secrets (e.g. KeyVault, Env or File). The way the secrets are stored are based on the subclass you choose. For example if we want to store the secrets in an environment variable we can initialize our SecretManagement class as follows: `SecretManagement.Env(env_variable="your_env_variable")`. This will make sure the secrets used in the Exact connector are stored in and extracted from your chosen environment variable.
        
        **Extracting data**<br>
        To get data, you need:
        
        - An endpoint name or a list of endpoint names which you can find in the [Exact API Documentation](https://start.exactonline.nl/docs/HlpRestAPIResources.aspx) (e.g. "Budgets")
