## Installation

```
pip install pip-abandoned
```

## Introduction

Some package registries like NPM and Packagist allow a user to mark a package as abandoned or deprecated. This means it is relatively easy to tell if you are relying on a package abandoned by its author. It also allows package managers to consume this metadata to provide a warning at install time. PyPI does not have a mechanism to abandon or deprecate a package. There are some signals we can look at though.

- Many packages are linked to a GitHub repository. If that GitHub repository is archived, this is a strong signal that the package itself is abandoned
- Some packages may use the `Development Status :: 7 - Inactive` trove classifier to indicate the package is not maintained

`pip-abandoned` uses these signals to identify potentially abandoned packages in your environment.

## Usage

An example invocation of `pip-abandoned` looks like:

```bash
GH_TOKEN=ghp_abc123 pip-abandoned /home/alice/.virtualenvs/myproject/lib/python3.10/site-packages
```

There are two things we need to supply:

- A path to a python (virtual) environment to search. This is passed as a positional parameter.
- A GitHub API token. This is set using an environment variable called `GH_TOKEN`. We need to provide this because `pip-abandoned` used the GitHub GraphQL API to efficiently query many repos at once. The advantage of this is that it is fast. The tradeoff is that authentication is required. A PAT with read-only access to public repos will be sufficient for most cases.

## Other Projects

`pip-abandoned` takes inspiration from [pip-audit](https://github.com/pypa/pip-audit), another great project.
