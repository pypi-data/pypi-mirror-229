# Classes coming in future versions of _encr_

NOTE: _encr_'s scope is changing rapidly, so some of these classes may not actually come to life.

## _tree_ and _file_

The _tree_ and _file_ classes will extend _encr_'s _.dumpfile_ and _.dumptree_ functionality, allowing you to load and edit files and folders directly within the script, and then saving it to the system.

We don't know exactly when it will be released. At the moment we plan to release it before version __1.0.0__

## _logsys_

_logsys_ is a class that implements _encr_ and other tools to add login functionality to your code. Password, email or USB verification will be included in it. 

We don't know exactly when it will be released. At the moment we plan to release it before version __2.0.0__
