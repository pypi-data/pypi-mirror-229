with the understanding that importing a Python modular is similar in spirit to dynamically linking
against it.

- You can use the library/CLI `prairie` in any project, for any purpose,
  as long as you provide some acknowledgement to this original project for
  use of the library (for open source software, just explicitly including
  `prairie` in the dependency such as a `pyproject.toml` or `Pipfile`
  is acknowledgement enough for me!).

- If you make improvements to `prairie`, you are required to make those
  changes publicly available.
