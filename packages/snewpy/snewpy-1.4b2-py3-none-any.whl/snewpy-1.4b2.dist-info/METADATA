SNEWPY is a Python package for working with supernova neutrinos. It offers …

* … a simple and unified interface to hundreds of supernova simulations.
* … a large library of flavor transformations that relate neutrino fluxes produced in the supernova to those reaching a detector on Earth.
* … and a Python interface to SNOwGLoBES which lets you estimate and plot event rates in many different neutrino detectors.


## Installation

### For Users
Run `pip install snewpy` to install SNEWPY.

SNEWPY includes a large number of supernova models from different simulation groups. Since these models have a size of several 100 MB, they are not included in the initial install. Instead, after installing, run the following command to download models you want to use:

`python -c 'import snewpy; snewpy.get_models()'`

By default, they will be downloaded to a subdirectory named `SNEWPY-models/<model_name>/` in the current directory.

### For Developers

**Your contributions to SNEWPY are welcome!** For minor changes, simply submit a pull request. If you plan larger changes, it’s probably a good idea to open an issue first to coordinate our work.

To contribute, first clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/SNEWS2/snewpy.git`), then make changes and install your modified version locally using `pip install .` from the base directory of the repository.
Once you’re happy with your changes, please submit a pull request.
Unit tests will run automatically for every pull request or you can run them locally using `python -m unittest python/snewpy/test/test_*.py`.

## Usage and Documentation
Example scripts which show how SNEWPY can be used are available in the
`python/snewpy/scripts/` subfolder as well as notebooks in `doc/nb/`.
Most downloadable models also include a Jupyter notebook with simple usage examples.

A paper describing SNEWPY and the underlying physics is available at [arXiv:2109.08188](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08188).
