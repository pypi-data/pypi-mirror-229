This BeamDS implementation follows the guide at 
https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/

prerequisits:

## Installation

To install the full package from PyPi use:
```shell
pip install beam-ds[all]
```
If you want to install only the data-science related components use:
```shell
pip install beam-ds[ds]
``` 
To install only the LLM (Large Language Model) related components use:
```shell
pip install beam-ds[llm]
```

The prerequisite packages will be installed automatically, they can be found in the setup.cfg file.

## Build from source

install the build package:
```shell
python -m pip install --upgrade build
```

to reinstall the package after updates use:

1. Now run this command from the same directory where pyproject.toml is located:
```shell
python -m build
```
   
2. reinstall the package with pip:
```shell
pip install dist/*.whl --force-reinstall
```

## Building the Beam-DS docker image

The docker image is based on the latest official NVIDIA pytorch image.
To build the docker image from Ubuntu host, you need to:

1. update nvidia drivers to the latest version:

```shell
scalene --reduced-profile --outfile OUTFILE.html --html --- your_prog.py <your additional arguments>
```

## Uploading the package to PyPi

1. Install twine:
```shell
python -m pip install --user --upgrade twine
```

2. Build the package:
```shell
python -m build
```
