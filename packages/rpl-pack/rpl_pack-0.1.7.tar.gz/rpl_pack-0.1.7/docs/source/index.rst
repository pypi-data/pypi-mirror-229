Welcome to rpl-pack's documentation!
====================================

**rpl-pack** is a Python library for interfacing with the `RPL Server <https://rock-physics-lab.herokuapp.com/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API for all your rock physics needs!


Check out the :doc:`quick_start` section for further information, including how to
:ref:`install <installation>` the project.


.. note::
   This project is under active development and the API is **not currently stable**.
   Therefore, we cannot guarantee that, as development continues, the API will be back-compatible
   with each new release. However, we will make an active effort to warn of any deprecated
   features, syntax, or otherwise ahead of the scheduled update. Feel free to contact us
   with any questions or concerns.
