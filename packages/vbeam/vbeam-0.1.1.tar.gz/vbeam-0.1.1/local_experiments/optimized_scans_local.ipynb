    "# Beamforming With Optimized Scans\n",
    "vbeam is built on top of high-level abstractions — we write Numpy-like code, wrap it with `jax.jit`, and hope for the best. We therefore do not have access to the same low-level optimizations that we would have if the beamformer was written in a language like C++ and CUDA. We are limited to high-level optimizations. One such optimization is simply doing less work. By filtering out redundant points from the scan, _before beamforming_, we can get a much faster beamformer. In this notebook we will explore how to perform such an optimization/pre-processing.\n",

There are a lot of resolution redundancy close to the aperture of a sector scan, as the points are so close together. If we scan convert the grid before beamforming these redundant pixels are merged together. Additionally, as the RTB apodization is quite wide close to the aperture, we get even more (relative) redundancy. We can combine the scan conversion and apodization filtering optimizations for an effect that it greater than the sum of its parts."
