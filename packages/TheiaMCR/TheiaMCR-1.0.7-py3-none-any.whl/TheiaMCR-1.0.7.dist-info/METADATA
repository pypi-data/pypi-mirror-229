# Theia Technologies motor control board interface
Theia Technologies offers a [MCR600 motor control board](https://www.theiatech.com/lenses/accessories/mcr/) for interfacing with Theia's motorized lenses.  This board controls focus, zoom, iris, and IRC filter motors.  It can be connected to a host comptuer by USB, UART, or I2C connection.  

# Features
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="python" width="40" height="40"/> The MCR600 board has a proprietary command protocol to control and get information from the board.  The protocol is a customized string of up to 12 bytes which can be deciphered in the MCR600 documentation.  However for ease of use, Theia has developed this Python module to format the custom byte strings and send them to the board.  The user can request the focus motor to move 1000 steps for example.  The focusRel function will convert this request to the appropriate byte string and send it over USB connection to the MCR control board.  This will cause the lens motor to move 1000 steps.  

# Quick start
This module can be loaded into a Python program.  
Theia's motorized lens should be connected to the MCR600 board and the board should be connected to the host computer via USB connection thorugh a virtual com port.  

# Functions
## Initialization functions
- MCRInit: initialize the  board
- focusInit, zoomInit, irisInit, IRCInit: initialize the appropriate motor (setup)
- focusHome, zoomHome, irisHome: move the motor to the home position
## Motor movement functions
- focusAbs, zoomAbs, irisAbs: move the motor to the home position then to an absolute step number
- focusRel, zoomRel, irisRel: move a relative number of steps
- IRCState: set the filter switch state (A/B)
## Information functions
- readFWRevision: read board firmware revision
- readBoardSN: read board serial number
