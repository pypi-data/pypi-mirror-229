class ClassPattern:
    """
    A class responsible for dynamically generating a blueprint of 
    a target class.

    The `ClassPattern` takes a dictionary representation of a class's 
    desired structure, including its inputs (attributes) and methods. 
    It then produces a dynamic blueprint of the target class, which 
    can be used to validate and instantiate the target class based 
    on this pattern.

    Attributes:
    - dict_class (dict): The dictionary describing the desired structure 
    of the target class.
    - ClassDesign (type): A dynamically generated class serving as the 
    blueprint for the target class.

    Note:
    The dynamic blueprint class (i.e., `ClassDesign`) expects all 
    attributes mentioned in 'inputs' to be provided during 
    instantiation. Additionally, it dynamically binds methods 
    defined in the 'methods' section of the `dict_class` to the 
    instance, allowing them to be invoked as regular methods.
