description = 
	The perf_baseline is a performance regression detection tool for Python projects.
	It uses timeit to automatically time your function,
	records the result as a baseline into a file,
	and compares subsequent test results against the initial baseline
	to detect performance regression based on your specified threshold.
	(We do not compare against the second-last performance test result,
	therefore your performance won't suffer from gradual decline.)
