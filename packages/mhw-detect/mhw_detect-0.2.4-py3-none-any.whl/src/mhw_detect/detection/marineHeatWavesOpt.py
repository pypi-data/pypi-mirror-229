      mhw     Detected marine heat waves (MHWs). Each key (following list) is a
              list of length N where N is the number of detected MHWs:

        'time_start'           Start time of MHW [datetime format]
        'time_end'             End time of MHW [datetime format]

        'intensity_cumulative' Cumulative intensity [deg. C x days]
        'rate_onset'           Onset rate of MHW [deg. C / days]
        'rate_decline'         Decline rate of MHW [deg. C / days]
        'intensity_max_relThresh', 'intensity_mean_relThresh', 'intensity_var_relThresh',
        and 'intensity_cumulative_relThresh' are as above except relative to the
        threshold (e.g., 90th percentile) rather than the seasonal climatology
        'intensity_max_abs', 'intensity_mean_abs', 'intensity_var_abs', and
        'intensity_cumulative_abs' are as above except as absolute magnitudes
        rather than relative to the seasonal climatology or threshold
        'category' is an integer category system (1, 2, 3, 4) based on the maximum intensity
        in multiples of threshold exceedances, i.e., a value of 1 indicates the MHW
        intensity (relative to the climatology) was >=1 times the value of the threshold (but
        less than 2 times; relative to climatology, i.e., threshold - climatology).
        Category types are defined as 1=strong, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=extreme. More details in
        Hobday et al. (in prep., Oceanography). Also supplied are the duration of each of these
        categories for each event.
        'n_events'             A scalar integer (not a list) indicating the total
                               number of detected MHW events
      clim    Climatology of SST. Each key (following list) is a seasonally-varying
              time series [1D numpy array of length T] of a particular measure:

        'seas'                 Climatological seasonal cycle
        'missing'              A vector of TRUE/FALSE indicating which elements in
                               temp were missing values for the MHWs detection
    Options:
      seas_climYear          Climatology mean vector
      thresh_climYear        Threshold vector
      climatologyPeriod      Period over which climatology is calculated, specified
                             as list of start and end years. Default is to calculate
                             over the full range of years in the supplied time series.
                             Alternate periods suppled as a list e.g. [1983,2012].
                             Unused if seas_climYear and thresh_climYear are set.
      pctile                 Threshold percentile (%) for detection of extreme values
                             (DEFAULT = 90)
                             Unused if seas_climYear and thresh_climYear are set.
      windowHalfWidth        Width of window (one sided) about day-of-year used for
                             the pooling of values and calculation of threshold percentile
                             (DEFAULT = 5 [days])
      smoothPercentile       Boolean switch indicating whether to smooth the threshold
                             percentile timeseries with a moving average (DEFAULT = True)
      smoothPercentileWidth  Width of moving average window for smoothing threshold
                             (DEFAULT = 31 [days])
      minDuration            Minimum duration for acceptance detected MHWs
                             (DEFAULT = 5 [days])
      joinAcrossGaps         Boolean switch indicating whether to join MHWs
                             which occur before/after a short gap (DEFAULT = True)
      maxGap                 Maximum length of gap allowed for the joining of MHWs
                             (DEFAULT = 2 [days])
      maxPadLength           Specifies the maximum length [days] over which to interpolate
                             (pad) missing data (specified as nans) in input temp time series.
                             i.e., any consecutive blocks of NaNs with length greater
                             than maxPadLength will be left as NaN. Set as an integer.
                             (DEFAULT = False, interpolates over all missing values).
      coldSpells             Specifies if the code should detect cold events instead of
                             heat events. (DEFAULT = False)
      alternateClimatology   Specifies an alternate temperature time series to use for the
                             calculation of the climatology. Format is as a list of numpy
                             arrays: (1) the first element of the list is a time vector,
                             in datetime format (e.g., date(1982,1,1).toordinal())
                             [1D numpy array of length TClim] and (2) the second element of
                             the list is a temperature vector [1D numpy array of length TClim].
                             (DEFAULT = False)
      Ly                     Specifies if the length of the year is < 365/366 days (e.g. a
                             360 day year from a climate model). This affects the calculation
                             of the climatology. (DEFAULT = False)
    Notes:
      1. This function assumes that the input time series consist of continuous daily values
         with few missing values. Time ranges which start and end part-way through the calendar
         year are supported.
      2. This function supports leap years. This is done by ignoring Feb 29s for the initial
         calculation of the climatology and threshold. The value of these for Feb 29 is then
         linearly interpolated from the values for Feb 28 and Mar 1.
      3. The calculation of onset and decline rates assumes that the heat wave started a half-day
         before the start day and ended a half-day after the end-day. (This is consistent with the
         duration definition as implemented, which assumes duration = end day - start day + 1.)
      4. For the purposes of MHW detection, any missing temp values not interpolated over (through
         optional maxPadLLength) will be set equal to the seasonal climatology. This means they will
         trigger the end/start of any adjacent temp values which satisfy the MHW criteria.
      5. If the code is used to detect cold events (coldSpells = True), then it works just as for heat
         waves except that events are detected as deviations below the (100 - pctile)th percentile
         (e.g., the 10th instead of 90th) for at least 5 days. Intensities are reported as negative
         values and represent the temperature anomaly below climatology.
