# Quantagonia API Client

This package contains Quantagonia's client-side APIs for using HybridSolver.
This includes:
- a plugin for PuLP to solve PuLP-generated models locally and in the client,
- a simple API to model QUBOs locally and solve them in the cloud and
- an importer to vonvert PyQUBO models into our format - allowing to solve PyQUBO models in QUantagonia's cloud.

The following notes are for Devlopers only.

## Installation

Python >= 3.8 is required. Then, do
```
python -m pip install quantagonia-api-client
```

Once done, one can run the examples in `examples/` through, e.g.,
```
QUANTAGONIA_API_KEY="<redacted>" python examples/submit_qubo.py
```
with a valid Quantagonia API key.
