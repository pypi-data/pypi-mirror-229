        If neither client requested to play a game from a specific UUID,
        then UUID will be empty string.

        There are three queues of players: General players, follower-only,
        and leader-only players. This lobby only uses the follower-only and
        leader-only queues.

        Follower-only queues can contain either human MTurk workers or follower
        bots, while leader-only queues only contain human MTurk workers. If a worker
        is qualified to be a leader, they will always be sent to the leader-only queue.

        Leader-only players are preferentially matched with human followers. If 10 seconds
        pass and there are no humans in the follower queue, the leader will be matched
        with the first player in the follower queue. If a queued player gets no matches
        in 5 minutes, they are removed from the queue.

        Leaders and followers are removed from their respective queues. If
        either queue is empty, leaves the other untouched.
