refactor this package

pylint changes

mypy and type hints

add type checking and pylint to makefile?

note MonkeyType dev version is needed

pre-commit hook

need to make tests more organized

each venue should a simple reprex and a reprex with :

    mutiple outputs
    mutiple plots

...use single reprex for this and have mutiple .md's to compare to

then also have pairs for corner cases:
    imports/non imports
    unicode
    two statements per line


entrypoint for CLI?
