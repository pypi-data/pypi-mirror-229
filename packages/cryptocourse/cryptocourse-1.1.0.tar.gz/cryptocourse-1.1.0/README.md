# Cryptography course
Code snippets to learn cryptography without the need to use other libraries. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION

Installation procedure: 
     pip3 install cryptocourse

Use it in Python, e.g.:
     from cryptocourse import basic_ec

On the github, you find some short code snippets to give you an idea how everything works. This material complements the cryptography course that I 
teach at Howest (https://www.howest.be).
