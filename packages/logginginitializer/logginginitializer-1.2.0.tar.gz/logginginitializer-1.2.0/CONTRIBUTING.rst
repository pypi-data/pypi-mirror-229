How to contribute to logginginitializer
=======================================

Thank you for considering contributing to logginginitializer!


Support questions
-----------------

Please, don't use the issue tracker for this. The issue tracker is a
tool to address bugs and feature requests in logginginitializer itself.


Reporting issues
----------------

Issues can be reported at our
`issue tracker <https://gitlab.com/rwsdatalab/projects/logginginitializer/-/issues>`__.
Include the following information in your post:

-   Describe what you expected to happen.
-   If possible, include a
    `minimal reproducible example <https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example>`__ to help us identify the issue. This also helps check that the issue is not with your own code.
-   Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there
    was an exception.
-   List your Python, logginginitializer, and other relevant versions. If possible, check if this issue is already fixed in the latest logginginitializer release or the latest development version.


Submitting patches
------------------

If there is not an open issue at our
`issue tracker <https://gitlab.com/rwsdatalab/projects/logginginitializer/-/issues>`__ for what you want to submit, prefer opening one for discussion before working on a PR.

When you start working on an issue, make sure to include the following in your patch:

-   Make sure your code passes the `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com>`__
    checks. Install pre-commit using the instructions below.

-   Include tests if your patch adds or changes code. Make sure the test
    fails without your patch.
-   Update any relevant docs pages and docstrings.


Installing pre-commit and requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Install logginginitializer in editable mode with development dependencies.

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
        pip install .

-   Install the pre-commit hooks.

    .. code-block:: bash

        pre-commit install


Start coding
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Create a branch to identify the issue you would like to work on. If
    you're submitting a feature addition, change or non-critical bug fix,
    branch off of the "develop" branch.

    .. code-block:: bash

        git fetch origin
        git checkout -b your-branch-name origin/develop

-   Critical bug fixes should be branched off of the "main" branch instead.

    .. code-block:: bash

        git fetch origin
        git checkout -b your-branch-name origin/main

-   Link to the issue being addressed with
    ``fixes #123`` in the merge or pull request.


Building the docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build the docs in the ``doc`` directory using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`__.

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py build_sphinx

Open ``doc/_build/html/index.html`` in your browser to view the docs.
