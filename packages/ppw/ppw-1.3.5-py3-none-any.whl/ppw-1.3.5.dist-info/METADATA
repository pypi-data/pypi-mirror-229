## cfg4py
[cfg4py](https://pypi.org/project/cfg4py/) is a great tool for managing configuration files, supporting configuration for different environments (dev, prodction and test), automatically converting yaml-based configuration to python class, so, you can access configuration items by attribute, thus, enable auto-completion (by IDE). It also supports live-reload, remoting central configuration, config template and more.
