Version: 1.3.1
Summary: A module powered by Machine-Learning algorithms designed to detect, recognize and read license plates from car pictures. The module is flexible and equipped with objects and functions to make the process_thresh of LPR easy and fast. The program creates an artificial k nearest neighbour model that detects and reads licensee plate from a car image.

---------------

#### description:

- visit the docs to learn more about this project and how to develop with it.

#### dependencies:

- opening:
  For this is a complex program, which uses a lot of modules, there are required dependencies needed
  in order to run the program. keep in mined the program was writen in python 3.9, so any python version lower
  than 3.9 might not work properly.

- install app dependencies by writing the "-r" option to install the requirements
  writen in a file, and write the following line in the project directory:
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

run a test
-----------

#### run from windows command line (inside the project directory)
- run with python by writing to the command line in the project directory:
````
python test.py
````
