# - Mturk Games (ListMturkGames): Games where at least one player is an mturk worker.
# - Research Games (ListResearchGames): Games that have research-quality language
#   data. These games are chosen based on the criteria in IsGameResearchData.
# - Config games: Games filtered by the provided server configuration. This
#   allows us to filter out old games that used separate rules, and to pool mturk
#   games together by trial (server config).
# - Analysis Games (ListAnalysisGames): Games selected from the pool of research
#   games filtered by the provided configuration. (Research & Config).
