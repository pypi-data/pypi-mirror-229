HRFParser
=========

Copyright (c) 2023 Sean Yeatts. All rights reserved.

A convenience pipeline for working with Human-Readable Formats ( HRFs ) such
as YAML and JSON. It's designed to easily read / write data between HRFs and
Python dictionaries, both in raw and flattened ( single key-value pairs )
formats.

Features:
    - Auto-conversion between different HRF formats based on file extensions.
    - 'Unpacking' of nested data to flattened, single key-value pairs.

Current supported HRFs:
    - YAML
    - JSON
