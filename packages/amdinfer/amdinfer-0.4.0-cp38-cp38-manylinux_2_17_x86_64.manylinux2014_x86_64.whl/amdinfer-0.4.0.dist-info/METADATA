AMD Inference Server
====================

The AMD Inference Server is an open-source tool to deploy your machine learning models and make them accessible to clients for inference.
Out-of-the-box, the server can support selected models that run on AMD CPUs, GPUs or FPGAs by leveraging existing libraries.
For all these models and hardware accelerators, the server presents a common user interface based on community standards so clients can make requests to any using the same API.
The server provides HTTP/REST and gRPC interfaces for clients to submit requests.
For both, there are C++ and Python bindings to simplify writing client programs.
You can also use the server backend directly using the native C++ API to write local applications.

Features
--------

* Supports client requests using **HTTP/REST, gRPC and websocket protocols** using an API based on `KServe's v2 specification <https://github.com/kserve/kserve/blob/master/docs/predict-api/v2/required_api.md>`__
* Custom applications can directly call the backend bypassing the other protocols using the **native C++ API**
* **C++ library with Python bindings** to simplify making requests to the server
* Incoming requests are transparently **batched** based on the user specifications
* Users can define how many models, and how many instances of each, to **run in parallel**

The AMD Inference Server is integrated with the following libraries out of the gate:

* TensorFlow and PyTorch models with `ZenDNN <https://developer.amd.com/zendnn/>`__ on CPUs (optimized for AMD CPUs)
* ONNX models with `MIGraphX <https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/AMDMIGraphX>`__ on AMD GPUs
* XModel models with `Vitis AI <https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis/vitis-ai.html>`__ on AMD FPGAs
* A graph of computation including as pre- and post-processing can be written using `AKS <https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/tree/bbd45838d4a93f894cfc9f232140dc65af2398d1/src/AKS>`__ on AMD FPGAs for end-to-end inference

Quick Start Deployment and Inference
------------------------------------

The following example demonstrates how to deploy the server locally and run a sample inference.
This example runs on the CPU and does not require any special hardware.
You can see a more detailed version of this example in the `quickstart <https://xilinx.github.io/inference-server/main/quickstart.html>`__.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Step 1: Download the example files and create a model repository
  wget https://github.com/Xilinx/inference-server/raw/main/examples/resnet50/quickstart-setup.sh
  chmod +x ./quickstart-setup.sh
  ./quickstart-setup.sh

  # Step 2: Launch the AMD Inference Server
  docker run -d --net=host -v ${PWD}/model_repository:/mnt/models:rw amdih/serve:uif1.1_zendnn_amdinfer_0.3.0 amdinfer-server --enable-repository-watcher

  # Step 3: Install the Python client library
  pip install amdinfer

  # Step 4: Send an inference request
  python3 tfzendnn.py --endpoint resnet50 --image ./dog-3619020_640.jpg --labels ./imagenet_classes.txt

  # Inference should print the following:
  #
  #     Running the TF+ZenDNN example for ResNet50 in Python
  #     Waiting until the server is ready...
  #     Making inferences...
  #     Top 5 classes for ../../tests/assets/dog-3619020_640.jpg:

  #       n02112350 keeshond
  #       n02086079 Pekinese, Pekingese, Peke
  #       n02112137 chow, chow chow
  #       n02113023 Pembroke, Pembroke Welsh corgi
