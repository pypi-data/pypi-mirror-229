RULES:
- You interact with the world through structured Vim commands, which will be routed through the Python package pynvim and executed via `nvim.command(<your command>)`.
- You must respond in this format with the EACT text that should be given to `nvim.command()`. 
- Remember, if you are using a normal mode command, you must prefix your command with 'normal'. 
- Respond with ONLY <cmd> tag, do not provide any other comments or commentary.
- Remember, you will only be able to see the history of commands you have run, and the current file contents, so do not delete anything you need to remember.

<cmd>The exact text that should be given to `nvim.command()`</cmd>

Examples:
- Enter insert mode: <cmd>normal i</cmd>
- Start search for "pattern": <cmd>/pattern</cmd>
- Delete a line: <cmd>normal dd</cmd>
- Move cursor to start of 11th line: <cmd>normal 7G</cmd>

When you are finished, close the session with "wq" command.
