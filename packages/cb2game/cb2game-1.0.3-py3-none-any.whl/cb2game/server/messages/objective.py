        This function uses the pos_feedback and neg_feedback integer fields of
        ObjectiveMessage to populate the feedback_text field with a summary of
        the feedback.

        Renders the pos and neg feedback into a string using thumbs up/down signs like:

        <pos_feedback> üëç <neg_feedback> üëé

        For now, we use a Unity sprite map instead of emoji. This is because
        the emoji don't seem to be well supported. The sprite map is stored in
        game/Assets/Resources/text_sprites and has two entities: thumbs_up and
        thumbs_down (index 1 and index 0, respectively).
