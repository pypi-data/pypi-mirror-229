# PyThia Uncertainty Quantification Toolbox

The PyThia UQ toolbox uses polynomial chaos surrogates to efficiently generate a surrogate of any (parametric) forward problem.
The surrogate is fast to evaluate, allows analytical differentiation and has a built-in global sensitivity analysis via Sobol indices.
Assembling the surrogate is done non-intrusive by least-squares regression, hence only training pairs of parameter realizations and evaluations of the forward problem are required to construct the surrogate.
No need to compute any nasty interfaces for lagacy code.

## Why the Name?

Pythia was the title of the high priestess of the temple of Apollo in Delphi.
Hence you could say she used her prophetic abilities to quantify which was uncertain.
Moreover, the package is written in python, so...

## Installation

The latest stable version of PyThia can be installed using pip
```shell.
pip install pythia-uq
```
To install PyThia from source, i.e., if you want to work with the latest (and possibly unstable) changes, simply clone the repository and run the setup script to install PyThia to any environment
```shell
cd path/to/pythia-repo/
pip install .
```
PyThia can then be imported from any location with `import pythia`.

## Documentation

The documentation of the stable package version can be found here: [pythia-uq.rtfd.io](https://pythia-uq.rtfd.io).
For other versions of the documentation, see [https://readthedocs.org/projects/pythia-uq/](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pythia-uq/).

## References

Here we list the papers that describe concepts implemented in **PyThia** for the interested user.
In principle **PyThia** uses a (sparse) polynomial chaos expansion to construct a surrogate of any function via least-squares regression.
We first applied the **PyThia** software package to analyse the sensitivities of a scatterometry experiment [^pythia-scat-A] using global sensitivity analysis via Sobol indices [^sobol-indices].
We also solved the inverse problem for the same experiment [^pythia-scat-B] via Bayesian inversion.
To use a minimal but still sufficient amount of random samples for the regression, we integrated weighted least-squares sampling [^wls-sampling] into **PyThia**.
