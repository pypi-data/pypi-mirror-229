# Dataset

This folder contains two sub-folders: `code-dataset` and `energy-dataset`, Below, we provide a brief explanation of each dataset:

**1. code-dataset:**
This folder contains the code dataset used in the project. It includes the source code along with the patched scripts of various deep learning projects selected for evaluation. Each project is organized in its own sub-folder, with the relevant code files and directory structure preserved. The code dataset enables researchers and developers to access the projects used in the study, explore the implementation details, and replicate the experiments.

**2. energy-dataset:**
The `energy-dataset` folder contains the energy profiling data collected during the experiments. Specifically, it includes method-level and project-level energy consumption data for each of the deep learning projects analyzed in the research. The dataset is provided in a json format, allowing users to access energy consumption information for individual methods across different projects.

Please note that the energy consumption data in the `energy-dataset` folder is linked to the corresponding projects in the `code-dataset` folder. Researchers and developers can use this dataset to gain insights into the energy consumption patterns of various deep learning methods and explore potential optimizations for energy-efficient development.
