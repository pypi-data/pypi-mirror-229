# Okay so I kicked off a batch of games and everything was running well. Several
# hours in, I get a bunch of complaints that the server crashed. I look and it
# appears the disk is full. I quickly delete some /tmp files and move the DB to
# a different directory to create a new one and start over the games. I then restart the game with a fresh database.

# Note that all of this was unnecessary. The disk was full. Deleting tmp files
# was sufficient, I could have left the DB file alone. I moved the DB and
# started a new one out of precaution because I suspected the file itself might
# just be too big.  Obviously without any real reason to suspect this. I was
# just at a lunch with friends when the crash happened and had to leave to fix
# this at a cafe across the street with wifi. I did this because I was under a
# lot of time pressure and wasn't thinking 100% clearly.

# Well, now I gotta merge those files. Here's the script to do it.

# If you're reading this because a similar thing happened in the future, this
# script is probably out of date. Check the fields in schemas/* to make sure
# that all the fields are correctly handled.

# 4 months pass.

# Okay, this script is coming in handy again! I've decided to migrate
# everything, and I can repurpose this script for that. Previously, things were
# too complicated and inefficient. We resend the entire map and props every time
# a game changes. Moves, instructions, actions, etc are all in separate tables,
# making logic to access games very complicated. Let's smoosh everything into one table: Events.
