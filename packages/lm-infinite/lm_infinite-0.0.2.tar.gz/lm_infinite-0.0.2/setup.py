LLMs, such as Transformer-based models, have shown impressive performance in various domains but struggle when it comes to longer reasoning processes or understanding larger contexts. Current pre-training schemes truncate training sequences to a fixed length, and even with relative positional encoding, LLMs struggle to generate coherent texts or perform downstream tasks after longer contexts.\n\nThe authors investigate the main out-of-distribution factors contributing to this problem and propose LM-Infinite as an efficient solution. LM-Infinite only requires a Î›-shaped attention mask and a distance limit, without any parameter updates or learning. It can be applied to different LLMs using relative-position encoding methods. LM-Infinite demonstrates consistent fluency and generation quality for sequences as long as 32k tokens on datasets like ArXiv and OpenWebText2, with a decoding speedup of 2.72x. Furthermore, it continues to perform well on inputs much longer than training lengths in downstream tasks like passkey retrieval, where vanilla models fail immediately.\n\n[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16137.pdf)\n\n---\n\n# Appreciation\n* Lucidrains\n* Agorians\n\n\n\n# Install\n`pip install lm-infinite`\n\n# Usage\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom infinite.main import LMInfinite\n\nd_model = 512\nseq_len = 100\nn_global = 100\nl_pretrain = 50\n\n\n#sample\nq = torch.randn(1, seq_len, d_model)\nk = torch.randn(1, seq_len, d_model)\nv = torch.randn(1, seq_len, d_model)\n\n\n#llm infinite mode\nmodel = LMInfinite(\n    d_model,\n    n_global,\n    l_pretrain\n)\n\n#forwad pass\noutput = model(q, k, v)\nprint(output.shape)\n```\n# Architecture\n\n# Todo\n\n\n# License\nMIT\n\n# Citations\n```latex\n@misc{2308.16137,\nAuthor = {Chi Han and Qifan Wang and Wenhan Xiong and Yu Chen and Heng Ji and Sinong Wang},\nTitle = {LM-Infinite: Simple On-the-Fly Length Generalization for Large Language Models},\nYear = {2023},\nEprint = {arXiv:2308.16137},\n}\n```',
