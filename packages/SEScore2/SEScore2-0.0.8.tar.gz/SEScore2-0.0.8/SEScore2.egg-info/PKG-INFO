SESCORE2, is a SSL method to train a metric for general text generation tasks without human ratings. We develop a technique to synthesize candidate sentences with varying levels of mistakes for training. To make these self-constructed samples realistic, we introduce retrieval augmented synthesis on anchor text; It outperforms SEScore in four text generation tasks with three languages (The overall kendall correlation improves 14.3%).
