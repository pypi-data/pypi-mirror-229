# plex

**A Python package for running scientific workflows on a decentralized infrastructure**

Plex is a Python package that allows scientists to run their workflows on a decentralized infrastructure. It is a client that can be used to run containers on a public network, and it supports distributed compute and storage. This means that scientists can use plex to run their workflows on any machine that is connected to the internet, and they can also use GPUs if they need them.

Plex is strictly composable, which means that every tool in plex has declared inputs and outputs. This makes it easy to plug together tools by different authors, and it also makes it easier to share results with other scientists.

In addition, every file processed by plex has a deterministic address based on its content. This means that you can always track your files and share the right results with other scientists.

The plex pip package provides a simple and easy way to install and use plex. It also includes documentation and examples to help you get started.
