# AIACC-NCCL

Optimized primitives for inter-GPU communication on aliyun machines.

## Introduction

AIACC-NCCL is an AI-Accelerator communication framework for NVIDIA-NCCL.
It implements optimized all-reduce, all-gather, reduce, broadcast, reduce-scatter, all-to-all, as well as any send/receive based communication pattern.
It has been optimized to achieve high bandwidth on aliyun machines using PCIe, NVLink, NVswitch, as well as networking using InfiniBand Verbs, eRDMA or TCP/IP sockets.

## Install

To install AIACC NCCL on the system, create a package then install it as root as follow two methods:

- method1: rpm/deb (Recommended)
```sh
# Centos:
wget http://mirrors.aliyun.com/aiacc/aiacc-nccl/aiacc_nccl-1.0.rpm
rpm -i aiacc-nccl-1.0.rpm
# Ubuntu:
wget http://mirrors.aliyun.com/aiacc/aiacc-nccl/aiacc_nccl-1.0.deb
dpkg -i aiacc-nccl-1.0.deb
```
- method2: python-env
```sh
wget http://mirrors.aliyun.com/aiacc/aiacc-nccl/aiacc_nccl-1.0.tar.gz
pip install aiacc_nccl-1.0.tar.gz
# notes: must download and then pip install, cannot merge in oneline `pip install aiacc_xxx_url` 
# Both method1 and method2 can run concurrently.
```

After install aiacc-nccl package, you need do nothing to change code!

## Environment

* ***AIACC_FASTTUNING***: Enable Fasttuning for LLMs, default=1 is to enable.
