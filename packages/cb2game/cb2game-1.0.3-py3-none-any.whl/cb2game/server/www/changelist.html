## July 25th, 2022
* Players have less time per turn to move:
    - Leader turn time: 60s -> 50s (new)
    - Follower turn time: 45s -> 15s (!!) (new)
    - This was done because games were taking significantly longer than expected. This lowered effective pay for players to unacceptable levels.

## July 8th, 2022
* New follower-only mturk task & queueing system.
* This paves the way for our new follower-only qual, to streamline the training of mturk workers.

## July 5th, 2022
* New, improved UI taking player feedback into account.
* Followers can no longer see card patterns (unless a card is selected). From the follower's POV, all card outlines are blue.
* The leader now has interrupt capabilities: Hold the interrupt button to take over the follower's turn.
* Improved maps with new assets (trees, houses, and lake formations. snowy mountains).
* Improved server performance (all noticeable lag should be gone!)

## March 29th, 2022
* Added Audio queues on game start and when its the player's turn.
* Fixes bug which allowed leaders to send a message when it wasn't their turn.

## March 28th, 2022
* Improved server performance, reducing latency.
* Changes to incentivize higher game quality:
    - Created experienced pool of players. Hopefully this results in higher scores + more payouts.
    - Reduced base payout of game to $0.15 (was $0.30).

## March 21st, 2022
* Added leaderboard (beta) and each worker is assigned a username.
* Workers can request to change their username.
* Fixed link on mturk task page, can now right-click and "open in new tab".

## March 12th, 2022
* Followers can no longer see red card borders.
* Improved card colors (pink and red less ambiguous)
* Live feedback is now more visible.
