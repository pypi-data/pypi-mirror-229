@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Example:
    """
    Represents a single prompt-completion classification example.

    This data structure is useful when different classification examples may belong to
    a different set of classes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    prompt : str
        string, which, e.g., contains the text to classify
    completions : Sequence[str]
        strings, where, e.g., each one is the name of a class which could come after the
        prompt
    prior : Sequence[float], optional
        a probability distribution over `completions`, representing a belief about their
        likelihoods regardless of the `prompt`. By default, each completion in
        `completions` is assumed to be equally likely
    end_of_prompt : str, optional
        the string to tack on at the end of every prompt, by default " "

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        if `prompt` is not a string
    TypeError
        if `completions` is not a sequence of strings
    TypeError
        if `prior` is not None, or it isn't a sequence
    ValueError
        if `prior` is a sequence but isn't 1-D
    ValueError
        if `prior` is a sequence but doesn't sum to 1
    ValueError
        if `prior` is a sequence but `completions` and `prior` are different lengths
