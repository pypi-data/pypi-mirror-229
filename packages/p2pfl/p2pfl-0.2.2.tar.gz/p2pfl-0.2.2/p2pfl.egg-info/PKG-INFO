P2PFL is a general-purpose open-source library for the execution (simulated and in real environments) of Decentralized Federated Learning systems, specifically making use of P2P networks and the Gossisp protocol.

## ✅ Features

- Easy to use and extend
- Fault tolerant
- Decentralized and Scalable
- Simulated (**to-do, changed in 0.2.0**) and real environments
- Privacy-preserving
- Framework agnostic

## 📥 Installation

> **Note**
> We recommend using Python 3.9 or lower. We have found some compatibility issues with Python 3.10 and PyTorch.

### 👨🏼‍💻 For users

To install the library, you can simply run:

```bash
pip install p2pfl
```

Or you can install it from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pguijas/p2pfl.git
cd p2pfl
pip install -e .
```

### 👨🏼‍🔧 For developers

To install the library for development we recommend using a virtual environment. For example, with `pipenv`:

```bash
pipenv install --requirements requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 TO DO

> **Note**
> Don't be shy, share your ideas with us!

- Agnostic installation with variants for different frameworks (include TensorFlow)
- Add secure channels and node authentication
- Improved simulation environment
- Control panel
- add FEMNIST example
- add typing
- New aggregation methods
- Hot node inclusion
- Secure aggregation
- Non trainable nodes (gossip nodes) to increase the efficiency of the network
