# Evaluation

## Overview

This folder contains the necessary files and structure to facilitate the results capturing process from evaluators who participated in the human validation of the study. The evaluation process involves six different projects, each stored in a separate subfolder. The evaluators were provided with specific instructions for validation, which are included in each of those subfolders. Additionally, there are two Excel files that play a crucial role in this process: `evaluator_mapping.xlsx` and `final_results.xlsx`.

### Description of Files

- `eval_mapping.xlsx`: This Excel file contains the mapping of evaluators and the projects assigned to them. It is used to keep track of which evaluator worked on which project during the validation process.

- `eval_results.xlsx`: This Excel file is used to capture the final evaluation results provided by the evaluators. It includes the consolidated evaluations for each project and criterion.

- `eval-1`, `eval-2`, ..., `eval-6`: These subfolders contain the individual projects that need to be validated. Each subfolder contains the necessary files for the respective project, along with an `instructions.docx` file that provides specific instructions for validation.
