This section shows some examples of the usage of py_pol.

The introductory examples show some simple calculations in order to learn how to usepy_pol. The advanced examples show some insights into the physical properties and constrains of polarization. It also includes some advanced calculations and techniques developed in py_pol.

All examples are made in both Jones and Mueller-Stokes formalisms.
