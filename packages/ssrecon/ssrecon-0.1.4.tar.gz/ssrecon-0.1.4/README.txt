This is just a simple library to perform the subset sum process for negative and postive 
floats with integer keys. 

It loops through the potential number of combinations to match, starting with 1 and 
ending with the value you give it in the provide

ssrecon.find_match(
    <List of tuples (FLOAT, INT)>,
    <Target to match FLOAT>,
    <Number of combos to iterate to INT>,
    <Verbose BOOL>
    )

Example:
>>> a, b = ssrecon.find_match([(1.0,1),(2.0,2),(3.0,3)],4.0,3,True)
Attempting with 1 combos
Attempting with 2 combos
>>> a
[1, 3]
>>> b
[1.0, 3.0]
