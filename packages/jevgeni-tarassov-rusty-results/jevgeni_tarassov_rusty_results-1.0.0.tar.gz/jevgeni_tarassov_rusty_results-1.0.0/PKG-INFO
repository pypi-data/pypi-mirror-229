# rusty-results

_Bringing some culture into the jungle._

This is a very simple project which **loosely** imitates the basics of Rust's `Result` struct. 

There is a [similarly named project](https://pypi.org/project/rusty-results/) by Danile Sanchez Quiros and 
Antonio Jose Checa Bustos, which is way more feature-complete.
