/*
 * This code (tentatively) defines a simulation of a TWI (a.k.a. I2C or SMBus) implementation
 * It supports multiple masters/slaves.
 * It does not support arbitration beyond the START condition and (currently) is not
 * multi-thread safe.
 * It is implemented by 4 classes:
 *  - TWIPacket defines a packet circulating on a bus simulating the successive exchange
 *    of information between mater and slave.
 *  - TWIEndPoint is an abstract interface defining a generic device connected to a TWI bus.
 *  - TWIBus defines a central object to circulate packets between multiple endpoints.
 *  - TWI is an implementation of a TWI interface for an AVR MCU, as generic
 *    as possible. It manages master and slave operations independently and communicates
 *    with upper layers via signals.
