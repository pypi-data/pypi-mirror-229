# CurricularAnalytics.py

**CurricularAnalytics.py** is a toolbox for studying and analyzing academic program curricula. The toolbox represents curricula as graphs, allowing various graph-theoretic measures to be applied in order to quantify the complexity of curricula. In addition to analyzing curricular complexity, the toolbox supports the ability to visualize curricula, to compare and contrast curricula, to create optimal degree plans for completing curricula that satisfy particular constraints, and to simulate the impact of various events on student progression through a curriculum.

CurricularAnalytics.py is a Python port of the original Julia package [CurricularAnalytics.jl](https://github.com/CurricularAnalytics/CurricularAnalytics.jl).
