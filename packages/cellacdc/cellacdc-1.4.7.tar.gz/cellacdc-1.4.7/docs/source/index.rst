Welcome to Cell-ACDC's documentation!
-------------------------------------

.. note::

   The building of this documentation is under active development. Please, refer to our `User Manual <https://github.com/SchmollerLab/Cell_ACDC/blob/main/UserManual/Cell-ACDC_User_Manual.pdf>`_ in the meanwhile

Cell-ACDC is a GUI-based Python framework for **segmentation**, **tracking**, **cell cycle annotations** and **quantification** of microscopy data.

You can load and analyse **2D, 3D** (either single z-stacks or 2D images over time) and **4D** (3D z-stacks over time) images.

Additionally, you can load **as many additional fluorescent channels** as you wish. Cell-ACDC will then compute many **numerical features** for each segmented cell, such as mean, sum, max, quantiles etc.
It also performs **automatic background correction** and computes **protein amount**.

Other numerical features computed are **cell volume**, and morphological properties of the segmented object.

Overview
--------

Let's face it, when dealing with segmentation of microscopy data we often do not have time to check that **everything is correct**, because it is a **tedious** and **very time consuming process**. Cell-ACDC comes to the rescue!
We combined the currently **best available neural network models** (such as `YeaZ <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19557-4>`_,
`Cellpose <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01018-x>`_, `StarDist <https://github.com/stardist/stardist>`_, and `YeastMate <https://github.com/hoerlteam/YeastMate>`_) and we complemented them with a **fast and intuitive GUI**.

We developed and implemented several smart functionalities such as **real-time continuous tracking**, **automatic propagation** of error correction, and several tools to facilitate manual correction, from simple yet useful **brush** and **eraser** to more complex flood fill (magic wand) and Random Walker segmentation routines.
