# Simple Transforms

Basic idea: A simple package for creating and using 4x4 transformation matrices as
numpy arrays.
 
## **Other Projects**

There are other more mature and more complete projects to use:
* [transforms3d](https://matthew-brett.github.io/transforms3d/)

I wrote my own because I needed it to use a custom data type - a 
[rounded floating point interval](https://github.com/jefwagner/numpy-flint).
