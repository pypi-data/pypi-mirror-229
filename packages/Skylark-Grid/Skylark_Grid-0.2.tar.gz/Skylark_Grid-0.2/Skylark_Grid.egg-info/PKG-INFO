# Image Grid Maker
The Image Grid is a Python script that merges a set of images into a grid and generates YOLO-style annotations for the merged images. This can be useful for creating custom datasets for object detection tasks.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install Numpy
```
## Usage

Import the ImageMerger class in your Python script:

```bash
from ImageMerger import ImageMerger
```

Create an instance of the ImageMerger class by providing the input directory, output directory, and other optional parameters:
python

```bash
input_dir = "input_images/"
output_dir = "output_images/"
merger = ImageMerger(input_dir, output_dir, group_size=4, image_shape=(320, 320))
```

Run the process_images() method to merge the images and generate YOLO annotations:
```bash
merger.process_images()
```

The merged images and corresponding YOLO annotations will be saved in the specified output directory.
Parameters
```bash
input_dir (str): Path to the directory containing input images and their corresponding YOLO annotation files.

output_dir (str): Path to the directory where the merged images and YOLO annotations will be saved.

group_size (int): Number of images to be merged into a single grid. Must have a specific square root value.

image_shape (tuple): Desired shape (height, width) for the output merged images.
```

Customization
You can customize the script by modifying the ImageMerger class to fit your specific requirements. For example, you can adjust the image size, grid size, or annotation format.
