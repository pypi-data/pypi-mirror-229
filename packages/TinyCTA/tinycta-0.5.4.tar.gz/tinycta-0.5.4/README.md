Underlying package for the 10-line cta

## Poetry

We assume you share already the love for [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org).
Once you have installed poetry you can perform

```bash
make install
```

to replicate the virtual environment we have defined in pyproject.toml.

## Jupyter

We install [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org) on fly within the aforementioned
virtual environment. Executing

```bash
make jupyter
```

will install and start the jupyter lab.
