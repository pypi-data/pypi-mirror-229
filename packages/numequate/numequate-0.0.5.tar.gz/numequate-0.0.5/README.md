## Usage

```python
from numequate.base import add, subtract, multiply, divide, power

resultAdd = add(5, 3)       # Returns 8
#result = subtract(10, 4) # Returns 6
#result = multiply(2, 6)  # Returns 12
#result = divide(10, 2)   # Returns 5
resultPower = power(3, 4)     # Returns 81

print(resultAdd, resultPower)
```

## Functions

### add(a, b)
Adds two numbers a and b and returns the result.

### subtract(a, b)
Subtracts the number b from a and returns the result.

### multiply(a, b)
Multiplies two numbers a and b and returns the result.

### divide(a, b)
Divides the number a by b and returns the result. Raises a ValueError if b is 0.

### power(base, exponent)
Calculates the result of raising the base to the power of exponent.

### clamp(value, min_value, max_value)
Clamps a value within the specified range.

### map_range(value, in_min, in_max, out_min, out_max)
Maps a value from one range to another.

### lerp(start, end, alpha)
Performs linear interpolation between two values.

### math(expression)
Calculates the provided numbers and content.

### factorial(n)
Finds the factorial of a chosen number.

### fibonacci(n)
Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

### gcd(a, b)
Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b.
