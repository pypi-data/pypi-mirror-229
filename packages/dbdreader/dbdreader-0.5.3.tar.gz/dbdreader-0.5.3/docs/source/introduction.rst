Introduction to dbdreader
*************************

The python package dbdreader is a package that can be used to read
binary data files that are generated by Teledyne WebbResearch Slocum
gliders see http://www.webbresearch.com.

The Slocum gliders produce binary data files that contain engineering
data or science data. Engineering data are stored in sbd or dbd files,
where sbd files contain a subset of the dbd files. Science data are
stored in tbd and ebd files. Also here the tbd files contain a subset
of the parameters in the ebd files.

The dbdreader package provides APIs for accessing a single binary file
or multiple binaries. The package lets you, for example,

- read the measured depth of a given dbd file, 
- retrieve CTD data from multiple ebd files, 
- retrieve heading, roll and pitch, interpolated on the time basis of
  depth



Installing dbdreader
====================

dbdreader is written for python3. Python2.7 is not supported.

The code is developed at github
(https://github.com/smerckel/dbdreader) from where you can get the
source code. 

Alternatively, the latest dbdreader package is available from the
python package index (https://pypi.python.org), so that you can
install it using pip.

Install using pip::

  pip install dbdreader


The dbdreader module contains a C extension, which requires a compiler
to be installed. Furthermore, as of version 0.5.1, dbdreader is able
to uncompress lz4-compressed data files, which requires the lz4
library and header files.

+---------+-------------------------------------------+
| Fedora  |  dnf install gcc lz4-libs lz4-devel       |    
+---------+-------------------------------------------+
| Ubuntu  |  apt-get install gcc liblz4-1 liblz4-dev  |

| Windows |  Microsoft C++ build tools  + lz4 ?       |

Dbdreader quickstart
====================

The package comes with a number of examples. However, to give you a
flavour of how easy it is to read one or two variables, consider the
example code below.

::

   import dbdreader
   
   dbd = dbdreader.DBD("unit204-2014-212-0-0.dbd")
   t,d = dbd.get("m_depth")
