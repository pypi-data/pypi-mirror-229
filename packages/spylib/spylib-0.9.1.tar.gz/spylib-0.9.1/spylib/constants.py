"""These are the text error codes thrown by the GraphQL API.

Although some errors throw a code e.g.

    "errors": [
        {
            "message": "Throttled",
            "extensions": {
                "code": "THROTTLED"
            }
        }

Not all provide the `code` parameter. Although you could just handle errors
based on the message, this becomes very difficult as some of the messages
are very long (see the max_cost_exceeded error output, which is ~350 characters)
