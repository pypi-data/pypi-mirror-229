![Harmon Chess Engine Logo](./images/logo.png) <!-- Add your project logo if available -->

Harmon Chess Engine is a cutting-edge chess engine that leverages the power of transformer-based machine learning models to revolutionize the world of computer chess. Unlike traditional chess engines, Harmon is designed to understand and exploit human mistakes, making it a formidable opponent for chess players of all levels.

## Features

- **Transformer-Powered Chess Engine**: Harmon uses state-of-the-art transformer models to predict human moves, allowing it to adapt its strategy based on the tendencies and mistakes commonly made by human players.

- **Human Mistake Exploitation**: Harmon's unique approach allows it to identify and capitalize on common human errors, giving it a strategic advantage in games.

- **Game Analysis**: Analyze your chess games to gain insights into your playing style and improve your skills. Harmon can provide detailed game summaries, identify key turning points, and suggest areas for improvement.

- **Elo Prediction**: Harmon can estimate the Elo rating of chess players based on their game performance, helping players gauge their progress and understand their strengths and weaknesses.

- **Game Outcome Prediction**: Harmon can predict the likely outcome of a chess game, providing players with valuable insights into the flow and dynamics of the match.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the Harmon Chess Engine repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/harmon-chess-engine.git
   cd harmon-chess-engine
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Train the model with your preferred dataset, such as PGN files from lichess.

2. Configure Harmon's settings and model parameters to suit your needs.

3. Run Harmon to analyze games, predict outcomes, or play chess against it.

### Example Usage

```python
# Import the Harmon Chess Engine library
import harmon

# Create a Harmon instance
engine = harmon.ChessEngine()

# Load a pre-trained transformer model
engine.load_model("path/to/pretrained/model")

# Analyze a chess game
analysis = engine.analyze_game("path/to/your/game.pgn")

# Get Elo predictions for players
elo_predictions = engine.predict_elo("path/to/players.pgn")

# Predict the outcome of a game
outcome_prediction = engine.predict_game_outcome("path/to/game.pgn")
```
